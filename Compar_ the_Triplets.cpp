https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compare-the-triplets/problem

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.
